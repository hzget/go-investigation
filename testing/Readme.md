# Testing

Automatic testcases make life easer for develpers.
After adding a new feature, the programmer can
add new cases to the pool of the existing testcases.
And then run (corresponding) testcases to check:

* bugs introduced by the new feature
* performance of the new feature
* performance of old features
* performance of the entire system
* other things

Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
Thus we need to be familiar with it.
